## M.Sc. in Physics of Data @ UniPd

### Hi there! :smiley: Welcome to my GitHub profile!

### :point_right: Basic informations:
I was born
* on February 26th, 2000 
* in Capua (CE), Italy

Currently living in 
* Padua (PD), Italy

### :zap: Briefly:

Studying Physics of Data. Graduated in Physics @ UniNa in 2021. 

Strong interest and skills in data science, machine learning, evolutionary algorithm and computational biophysics.


### :mortar_board: What the B.Sc. in Physics taught me:

The bachelor's degree has formed my skills in advanced physics, mathematics and statistics. In addition, it has allowed
me to acquire a mindset aimed at solving a wide range of complicated problems by exploiting different skills at the same
time. I have also developed the ability to work in a team and to write reports or scientific articles.

My final dissertation, titled ["Implementation and evaluation of Firefly Algorithm"](https://github.com/LucaSantagata/Firefly-Algorithm) (link to the GitHub
repository), exploits the Firefly Algorithm,a population-based optimization algorithm and mimics a fireflyâ€™s attraction to flashing light, which has been proposed by Xin-She Yang (2008) at the University of Cambridge Cambridge. .
